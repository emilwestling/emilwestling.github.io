      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        This website is mainly for personal entertainment, but let me share a
        bit about myself: I'm a senior in college with a passion for
        mathematics, technology, finance. I've developed a deep knowledge in
        programming and data analysis through my coursework, internships, and
        extra curriculars. I was born and raised in Sweden but moved to the
        United States three years ago to complete an undergraduate degree while
        also competing in NCAA D1 tennis. Following graduation I plan to use my
        skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the field of
        finance.

        </h3>
        <p>
          As I wrap up my Computer Science curriculum at Furman University, I
          had the opportunity to undertake a project of my choice. Based on my
          interests and future career goals, I figured it would be a good
          expreience to dive into the world of algorithmic trading.
